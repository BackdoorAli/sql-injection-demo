**Project: SQL Injection Demo Web App**  
GitHub: [https://github.com/BackdoorAli/sql-injection-demo](https://github.com/BackdoorAli/sql-injection-demo)

Built a vulnerable and secure version of a web application to demonstrate SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks and prevention techniques. This project showcases:

- SQL injection attack simulation via login and search forms
- Use of insecure dynamic SQL and its risks
- Secure implementation using parameterized queries (prepared statements)
- Automated SQLi testing with `pytest`
- Clean UI using Bootstrap for better user experience
- Jupyter notebook walkthrough explaining the vulnerability and solution
- Docker support for isolated sandbox testing
- Multi-stage Docker builds and runtime toggle support (secure/insecure)
- CI/CD pipeline integration via GitHub Actions
- Docker Compose and Makefile for streamlined dev experience

**Skills demonstrated:** SQL, Python, Flask, Web Security, Input Validation, Testing, CI/CD, Docker, Automation
